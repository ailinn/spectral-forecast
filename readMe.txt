This project uses 3 arrays as the inputs: two of them as samples from a healthy and a non-healthy patients, while the other one is a sample from a patient that wants to find out about his health state. It gives the user an output as a similarity index between the array sample from a patient and the other samples. The output is represented by the values that are calculated and displayed in a line graph. 

The computation is based on the equations from the article above.
